### What's This About?

He knows he shouldn't have procrastinated, but he did and now he's paying the price.

"I didn't want to wait until the last minute, there was just too much to do and never enough time!"

So he sits and tries to work on his work project that's due tomorrow. He needs some ideas so he decides to spend just 30 minutes on brainstorming and starts Googling. 15 minutes later and he found himself on Reddit. True, there was a search result leading him there, but there were no answers...just a gif showing a dog getting himself out of an icy pond.

"I bet there's some good comments here, let me just look at a few..."

And now an hour has gone by and he starts to panic. He gets up and starts to pace. Pacing usually calms him down. He thinks about what he's going to write. "This is _great_!", he thinks, "I'm coming up with so many ideas. Once this is done with I should treat myself to a weekend in the mountains. I wonder what the weather is going to be like this weekend. Let me check." Then 30 minutes go by and he forgets what he thought about.

Does this sound familiar? It's OK if it does, I won't judge you. This is my life and I hate it. I know I shouldn't feel bad because I am a lot better off than a lot of people I see on the streets when I walk to work. But I just can't help but feel like I'm a failure. I should be much better than this. When did I lose control over my life? Why can't I focus on anything for more than a minute? Is it the Internet's fault? No, it's my fault, I'm lazy and lack motivation. I skate by at work and because I try to maintain a positive attitude nobody knows the imposter that I am. But deep down, I know who I am and what I lack. And soon, everyone will know. All it'll take is one misstep and people will discover that I'm not good at what I do. And if I get fired will I be able to find another job? Maybe I should just quit and tell people that I needed a change. There must be _something_ I can do!

There _is_ something. I discovered some techniques that helped me and I want to share them with you. Do you think you don't have the time? I'm pretty sure that you do. It might take longer, but if you're consistent then over time you might also feel yourself changing like I did. This isn't some snake oil sales thing. I'm not promising you anything. I freely admit that a lot of what I'm writing about has been written time and time again. The thing is, everyone is unique and has their own perspective. I started this project because I feel there may be others out there like me, who on the outside seem confident, but on the inside it feels like there's a torrent of ideas, due dates, and meetings that keeps you from starting on anything because you're thinking of something else that needs to be done. The tips I give have been given before, so you may wonder why you should be listening to a total stranger. Well, allow me to introduce myself. If there's just one person out there that can relate to my experiences, and finds this stuff helpful, then all of this will be worth it. Thank you for reading so far, let's get to the good stuff.

### The Habits I Learned From Stephen Covey

There's this book that I'm sure you've heard about. You may have even read it. I received the book from my manager in 2008 and tried to read it but thought it was a little to out there. There was nothing wrong with my life (or so I thought) so I put the book away. Nine years later I was sick and wanted to read something new. The only thing in my bookcase that was new was _The 7 Habits_ book so I decided what the hell. There were parts of the book that felt too spiritual, I'll spare you the details but that tends to be off-putting for me. I respect everyone's beliefs and feel that if it helps you and doesn't hurt others then it's a good thing. But there were several really good points that he makes. There's really no such thing as a fix-it guide for people. But it doesn't mean that none of the things that people give as "tips" are useless. I feel that you should try things and see how you feel. Over time you will develop your own system and you'll feel so good about it that you'll want to share it with others.

So what did I learn from Stephen Covey's book? I liked what he said about how bad events in life may occur, but we have 100% control over our response. It's similar to Vikor E. Frankl's book, _Man's Search for Meaning_ which is another book I recommend. If you wanted to, you could come up with fifty ways to worry yourself in a day. But a lot of what we worry about is made up in our imagination. Before you panic and stress out, ask yourself this: "In this very second, is there anything that's physically hurting me?" If the answer is yes then please stop reading and call for help. But most of us will answer no. Our minds may make up some crazy story that makes us feel sick to our stomachs, but it's all in our minds. I'm not saying that there's no such thing as intuitions, or highly probable events. But until the future is now, it's still outside our control. We can't do anything about the past either. All we have is the present, and when you think about it that is such a great feeling. You want to plan for the future, but don't make up stories to freak yourself out. And since you can't change the past, all you have to focus on is what's happening this very second. Savor that moment.

### Categories of Life Improvement

The other thing I learned from _The 7 Habits_ is that we have many facets in our life and we need to pay attention to them all. You don't have time because you're too busy at work, or taking care of the kids? I feel for you, but there are ways we can get some balance back in our lives and still tend to the many responsibilities we have. Here's a post I wrote about [a balanced life](http://).

### My Morning Routine

You may not be a morning person, that's OK. I wasn't a morning person either, although as I got older it seems my body has helped me adapt to going to sleep earlier and waking up earlier. In any case, you can try these things any time that fits your schedule. But this is what works for me:

5:45 AM - Wake up, drink a glass of water
5:50 AM - Meditation exercise (I use Headspace)
6:10 AM - Make coffee
6:15 AM - Write in journal while coffee is brewing
6:30 AM - Drink coffee and read something educational, or read journal entry from 1 year ago
6:50 AM - Push-ups
7:05 AM - Go for a walk around the neighborhood
7:30 AM - Get ready for work

I find that the drink of water quickly wakes my mind up, but it's still in a calm state so meditating early feels right. My favorite part of the morning is drinking coffee and reading a few pages. It can be a new book I'm reading, or an educational piece, or lately I've been going back to my old journal entries to see what I wrote. It can be very humbling, and sometimes humerous to read. By the time I get my morning stroll in I am thoroughly ready to take on the day. It does mean that I'm tired by 9 PM, but to me it's worth it because I feel so much better during the day.
