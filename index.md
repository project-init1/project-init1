## Welcome to Project Init-1

### What's This About?

He knows he shouldn't have procrastinated, but he did and now he's paying the price.

"I didn't want to wait until the last minute, there was just too much to do and never enough time!"

So he sits and tries to work on his work project that's due tomorrow. He needs some ideas so he decides to spend just 30 minutes on brainstorming and starts Googling. 15 minutes later and he found himself on Reddit. True, there was a search result leading him there, but there were no answers...just a gif showing a dog getting himself out of an icy pond.

"I bet there's some good comments here, let me just look at a few..."

And now an hour has gone by and he starts to panic. He gets up and starts to pace. Pacing usually calms him down. He thinks about what he's going to write. "This is _great_!", he thinks, "I'm coming up with so many ideas. Once this is done with I should treat myself to a weekend in the mountains. I wonder what the weather is going to be like this weekend. Let me check." Then 30 minutes go by and he forgets what he thought about.

Does this sound familiar? It's OK if it does, I won't judge you. This is my life and I hate it. I know I shouldn't feel bad because I am a lot better off than a lot of people I see on the streets when I walk to work. But I just can't help but feel like I'm a failure. I should be much better than this. When did I lose control over my life? Why can't I focus on anything for more than a minute? Is it the Internet's fault? No, it's my fault, I'm lazy and lack motivation. I skate by at work and because I try to maintain a positive attitude nobody knows the imposter that I am. But deep down, I know who I am and what I lack. And soon, everyone will know. All it'll take is one misstep and people will discover that I'm not good at what I do. And if I get fired will I be able to find another job? Maybe I should just quit and tell people that I needed a change. There must be _something_ I can do!

There _is_ something. I discovered some techniques that helped me and I want to share them with you. Do you think you don't have the time? I'm pretty sure that you do. It might take longer, but if you're consistent then over time you might also feel yourself changing like I did. This isn't some snake oil sales thing. I'm not promising you anything. I freely admit that a lot of what I'm writing about has been written time and time again. The thing is, everyone is unique and has their own perspective. I started this project because I feel there may be others out there like me, who on the outside seem confident, but on the inside it feels like a torrent of ideas, due dates, and meetings that keeps you from starting on anything because you're thinking of something else that needs to be done. The tips I give have been given before, so you may wonder why you should be taking tips from a total stranger. Well, allow me to introduce myself. If there's just one person out there that can relate to my experiences, and finds this stuff helpful, then all of this will be worth it. Thank you for reading so far, let's get to the good stuff.
